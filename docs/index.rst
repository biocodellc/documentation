Welcome to FIMS documentation
==============================================

Contained here is documentation for users and developers of the FIMS field information management software.  
FIMS is a modular application, so most of the content here is directed to those features shared in the common
set of functions and services contained in the "Biocode FIMS Commons" (and representated in code at biocode-fims-commons.jar),
which drive the creation of all identifiers, and interpreting validation rules.
