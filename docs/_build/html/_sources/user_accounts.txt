User Accounts
===============

User accounts are not required to lookup/resolve BCIDs.  However, they are required to work with projects, expeditions, or create new BCIDs.  Here we describe how to obtain a user account for Biocode-

Account Creation
----------------

User accounts can be created by either by the Biocode-Fims instance owner or by project administrators. Project administrators can add any existing user in the Biocode-Fims system as an authorized expedition creator.  Talk to your project administrator to be added to a particular project.

Project Administrators
----------------

Project administrators are set by the Biocode-Fims instance owner upon request.  There is only one designated project administrator per project.  The project administrator can add, create, and remove users, set the location of the validation XML file, and define the project abstract.
