Introduction
===================

Biocode-FIMS is used for data validation, expedition planning, and data management for field-based surveys enabling tracking physical objects including organisms, soil cores, water samples, and sub-samples.  If you would like to start your own Biocode FIMS project, you can either download and install the relevant modules (all freely available) or contact the owner of the 
`BiSciCol FIMS installation`_ code site to see if you can be added as a project to this installation.
