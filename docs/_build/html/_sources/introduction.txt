**Running Biocode-FIMS**

Biocode-FIMS is used for generating spreadsheet templates and validating data for field expeditions, typically involving 
genomic workflows and working with biological samples and sub-samples.  Biocode FIMS can be run as a command-line application, 
through a web-interface, or portions of FIMS instances can be accessed via REST services.

If you would like to start your own Biocode FIMS project, you can either download and install the source code or contact the owner of the 
Biocode FIMS code site to see if you can be added as a project to an existing installation.
