# FIMS Documentation
FIMS documentation can be read at our [FIMS documentation site](http://fims.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  This 
repository stores the pages that drive this documentation.   When you push commits to this repo, built using sphinx, 
a readthedocs webhook will automatically build your changes in the live site.  For more information on this process,
visit [Readthedocs getting started guide](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html).
