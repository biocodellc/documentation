# FIMS Documentation
FIMS documentation can be read at our [http://fims.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ FIMS documentation site].  This 
repository stores the pages that drive this documentation.   When you push commits to this repo, built using sphinx, 
a readthedocs webhook will automatically build your changes in the live site.  For more information on this process,
visit [http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html Readthedocs getting started guide ]
